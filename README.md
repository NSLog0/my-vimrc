My vimrc that I use everyday

Hi all, this repo I would like to share my .vimrc with who is interesting to use vim and looking for a configuration, In the file has a plugin which is setting for Web develpment, mostly.

I'm using https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug to manange plugins such as install, remove and update. To use .vimrc file just copy to your OS or pickup a piece of code you need.


#### Please copy file or fork to you own respo. Do not commit or try to edit file on this respo 

Ps. This repo is up to date and ready to use, I will keep update config and setting.
